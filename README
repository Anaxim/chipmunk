ABOUT CHIPMUNK:
  Chipmunk is a simple, lightweight and fast 2D rigid body physics library 
  written in C by Slembcke. It's licensed under the unrestrictive, OSI approved 
  MIT license. 
  
ABOUT THESE RUBY BINDINGS:  
  Although chipmunk comes with ruby bindings, they are not always up to date 
  with regards to the functionality of the C library, and historically, they
  have been incompatible with recent versions of Ruby. 
    
  Therefore, these bindings are intended to as an enhanced version with more 
  features and better compatibility with recent versions of Ruby. They are also 
  intended to be an alternative to the chipmunk-ffi bindings when performance 
  is of the utmost importance, as it may be for games. 
  
  The intent is for these bindings to be source code compatibe with both 
  Slembcke's and ffi's bindings, with the former taking precedence on the 
  latter. If you have any problems with these bindings, please contact the 
  maintainer at beoran@rubyforge.org.
  
CONTRACTING:
  Howling Moon Software (Slembke's company) is available for contracting if you
