ABOUT CHIPMUNK:
  Chipmunk is a simple, lightweight and fast 2D rigid body physics library 
  written in C by Slembcke. It's licensed under the unrestrictive, OSI approved 
  MIT license. 
  
ABOUT THESE RUBY BINDINGS:    
  Although chipmunk comes with ruby bindings, they are not always up to date 
  with regards to the functionality of the C library, and historically, they
  have been incompatible with recent versions of Ruby. 
    
  Therefore, these bindings are intended to as an enhanced version with more 
  features and better compatibility with recent versions of Ruby. They are also 
  intended to be an alternative to the chipmunk-ffi bindings when performance 
  is of the utmost importance, as it may be for games. 
  
  The intent is for these bindings to be mostly source code compatible with the
  FFI bindings. Main exceptions are when it did not support the functionality I
  added yet. All this is documented by specs and by the html documentation.
  
  If you have any problems with these bindings, please contact the maintainer at
  beoran@rubyforge.org, or report the issue on the issue tracker:  
  https://github.com/beoran/chipmunk/issues
  
INSTALLATION
  These bindings vendor Chipmunk 5.3.4 with a few extra patches, so a gem 
  install chipmunk should do the trick. Optionally, the C chipmunk library 
  may be installed separately. To compile without vendoring, go to the 
  ext/chipmunk directory and compile with ruby extconf.rb --disable-vendor ; 
  make ; make install.
    
DOCUMENTATION:
  Full handcrafted documentation based on the C documentation is available at:
  http://beoran.github.com/chipmunk/
  
CHANGES:
  * Since 5.3.4.1: Vendored chipmunk again, cleanly. Several bugfixes.
  * Since 5.1.0  : Much more of Chipmunk's functionality is wrapped. Unvendored 
    chipmunk. More specs and documentation.
  
KNOWN BUGS:
  * There are no bindings to SpaceHash since I think they are not so useful
    anymore since Chipmunk supports BB queries.
  * Some methods may crash with a segentation violation in case they are not
    used correctly, according to the underlying requirements of the C library.
  
CONTRACTING:
  Howling Moon Software (Slembke's company) is available for contracting if you 
  want to make the physics in your game really stand out. Feel free to contact 
  them through their webpage: http://howlingmoonsoftware.com/contracting.php

TODO:
  * Allow several constructors to be more flexible and take nil as a default
    argument.
  * Try to prevent segfauts on incorrect use of certain methods, if possible.
  * Get ready for chipmunk 5.3.5 and 6.x when they come out.
  * Some more specs.
