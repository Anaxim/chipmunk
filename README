ABOUT CHIPMUNK:
  Chipmunk is a simple, lightweight and fast 2D rigid body physics library 
  written in C by Slembcke. It's licensed under the unrestrictive, OSI approved 
  MIT license. 
  
ABOUT THESE RUBY BINDINGS:  
  Although chipmunk comes with ruby bindings, they are not always up to date 
  with regards to the functionality of the C library, and historically, they
  have been incompatible with recent versions of Ruby. 
    
  Therefore, these bindings are intended to as an enhanced version with more 
  features and better compatibility with recent versions of Ruby. They are also 
  intended to be an alternative to the chipmunk-ffi bindings when performance 
  is of the utmost importance, as it may be for games. 
  
  The intent is for these bindings to be mostly source code compatible with both 
  Slembcke's and ffi's bindings. Main exceptions are where I dislike either API. 
  In that case, I made an API that is pleasing to myself, and similar in naming 
  to the C API adjusted to ruby conventions. If you have any problems with these bindings, please contact the maintainer at beoran@rubyforge.org.
  
INCOMPATIBILITIES:
  There are no bindings to SpaceHash since I fail to see the use of it, but
  if someone is using them, I'll probably implement them.
  
CONTRACTING:
  Howling Moon Software (Slembke's company) is available for contracting if you 
  want to make the physics in your game really stand out. Feel free to contact 
  them through their webpage: http://howlingmoonsoftware.com/contracting.php
